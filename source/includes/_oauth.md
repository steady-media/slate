# OAuth 2.0

## Create your app
Before you can begin the OAuth process, you must first register a new app with Steady. You can do this in your Steady backend for the project (OWN PROJECTS -> PROJECT -> INTEGRATE -> API).

<aside class="notice">
  The redirect URI is where Steady will redirect the user-agent after the user authorizes (or denies) your application (e.g. https://your-website.com/oauth/callback).
</aside>

## Client ID and Client Secret
Once your application is registered, Steady will issue "client credentials" in the form of a *client identifier* and a *client secret*. The Client ID is a publicly exposed string that is used by the Steady API to identify your application, and is also used by you to build authorization URLs that are presented to users in your application. The Client Secret is used to authenticate the identity of your application when your application requests to access a user's account, and must be kept private between your application and the API.

## Authorization Grant
The first steps in the OAuth 2.0 flow are about obtaining an authorization grant and access token for a user.

### Grant Type: Implicit
We don't offer this flow for clients which cannot use a client secret (e.g. Single Page Apps). Please use Authorization Code grant without client secret for better security.

### Grant Type: Authorization Code
The authorization code grant type is the most commonly used because it is optimized for server-side applications, where source code is not publicly exposed, and the *client secret* can be maintained confidentiality. This is a redirection-based flow, which means that the application must be capable of interacting with the user-agent (i.e. the user's web browser) and receiving API authorization codes that are routed through the user-agent.

[![Authorization Code Flow](https://steady.imgix.net/gfx/developers/auth_code_flow.jpg)](https://steady.imgix.net/gfx/developers/auth_code_flow.jpg)

### Step 1: Insert an Authorization Code Link

```text
  https://steadyhq.com/oauth/authorize?
    response_type=code&
    client_id=CLIENT_ID&
    redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
    scope=read&
    state=RANDOM_STRING
```

Create an authorization link, which sends your user to Steady:

`https://steadyhq.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&scope=read&state=RANDOM_STRING`

Parameter | Value
-------------- | --------------
response_type | **code** specifies that your application is requesting an authorization code grant
client_id | the **CLIENT_ID** can be found in the Steady Backend
redirect_uri | the **REDIRECT_URI** you have set in the Steady Backend. After authorization Steady will redirect the user-agent to this URI.
scope | **read** specifies the level of access your application is requesting
state | a **RANDOM_STRING** generated by your application, which you'll verify later

### Step 2: User authorizes your application at Steady
When the user clicks the link, they must first log in to Steady, to authenticate their identity (unless they are already logged in).
When the **scope** is set to **read** the user is **authorized automatically** in order to achieve a smooth user experience.
Otherwise the user will be prompted by Steady to authorize or deny your application access to their account. Here is an example authorize application prompt:

<img src="https://steady.imgix.net/gfx/developers/user_authorize_app.png" width="300">

### Step 3: Your application receives an authorization code
```text
  https://your-website.com/oauth/callback?
    code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&
    state=RANDOM_STRING
```

If the user gives the authorization, Steady redirects the user-agent to your application redirect URI, which was specified during the client registration, along with an authorization code. The redirect would look something like this:

`https://your-website.com/oauth/callback?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&state=RANDOM_STRING`

Parameter | Value
-------------- | --------------
code | **authorization code** you use to request an access token
state | the same **state** value you passed in before

<aside class="notice">
 You should first compare the <b>state</b> value to ensure it matches the one you started with. You can typically store the state value in local storage or a cookie, and compare it when the user comes back. This ensures your redirection endpoint isn't able to be tricked into attempting to exchange arbitrary authorization codes.
</aside>

### Step 4: Your application requests the access token
```http
POST /api/v1/oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Host: steadyhq.com
```
```javascript
{
  "client_id": CLIENT_ID,
  "client_secret": CLIENT_SECRET,
  "grant_type": "authorization_code",
  "code": AUTHORIZATION_CODE,
  "redirect_uri": REDIRECT_URI
}
```

The application requests an *access token* from the Steady API, by passing the authorization code along with authentication details, including the client secret, to the API token endpoint.

`https://steadyhq.com/api/v1/oauth/token`

Parameter | Value
-------------- | --------------
client_id | the **CLIENT_ID** can be found in the Steady Backend
client_secret | the **CLIENT_SECRET** can be found in the Steady Backend. Optional.
grant_type | **authorization_code** specifies that this request is within an Authorization Code grant flow
code | the **AUTHORIZATION_CODE** received in [Step 3](#step-3-your-application-receives-an-authorization-code)
redirect_uri | the **REDIRECT_URI** you have set in the Steady Backend

<aside class="notice">
  The <b>client_secret</b> parameter is optional. Only send it from save environments like your webserver.
  Omit it from mobile, native and Single-Page apps. Without <i>client_secret</i> you won't receive a <i>refresh_token</i>.
</aside>

### Step 5: Your application receives the access token
```http
HTTP/1.1 201 CREATED
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

```javascript
{
  "access_token": "V1JvWWVXdHcxajkzK1FBdDRwSS95UT09",
  "refresh_token": "MXpyNWRJRUdaMHg0aW9MM2ZJb1lVQT09"
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 604800,
  "scope": "read",
  "info": {
    "id": "5e7607b0-1458-41e4-b6bc-e6301c39e7da",
    "first-name": "Jane",
    "last-name": "Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
  }
}
```
If the authorization request from [Step 4](#step-4-your-application-requests-the-access-token) is valid, Steady will send a response containing the *access token*.

Parameter | Value
-------------- | --------------
access_token | the **access token** issued by Steady
refresh_token | the **refresh token** issued by Steady / null
token_type | the **type** of the token issued (bearer)
expires_in | time in seconds until the access token **expires**
scope | specifies the **level of access** granted
info | the **basic user information**

<aside class="success">
  Congratulations! You are now able to make requests to the Steady API on behalf of the user until the <i>access token</i> expires or is revoked.
</aside>

## Refresh the access token
```http
POST /api/v1/oauth/token HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Host: steadyhq.com
```
```javascript
{
  "client_id": CLIENT_ID,
  "client_secret": CLIENT_SECRET,
  "grant_type": "refresh_token",
  "refresh_token": REFRESH_TOKEN,
  "redirect_uri": REDIRECT_URI
}
```

If a *refresh token* was issued, it may be used to request new access tokens if the original token has expired. Steady only issues a refresh token if you send the *client secret* along in [Step 4](#step-4-your-application-requests-the-access-token).
Make your request to refresh the *access token* to this endpoint:

`https://steadyhq.com/api/v1/oauth/token`

Parameter | Value
-------------- | --------------
client_id | the **CLIENT_ID** can be found in the Steady Backend
client_secret | the **CLIENT_SECRET** can be found in the Steady Backend.
grant_type | **refresh_token**
refresh_token | the **REFRESH_TOKEN** received in [Step 5](#step-5-your-application-receives-the-access-token)
redirect_uri | the **REDIRECT_URI** you have set in the Steady Backend

<aside class="notice">
  If no <i>refresh token</i> was issued or it has also expired go back to <a href="#step-1-insert-an-authorization-code-link">Step 1</a>. If the user is logged in at Steady and there is still a valid authorization from the user, <a href="#step-2-user-authorizes-your-application-at-steady">Step 2</a> will be omitted and you'll receive a new <i>authorization code</i> (<a href="#step-3-your-application-receives-an-authorization-code">Step 3</a>), otherwise the flow continues at <a href="#step-2-user-authorizes-your-application-at-steady">Step 2</a>.

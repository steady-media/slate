# Introduction

Welcome to the Steady API!

You can use our REST-API to fetch data in the scope of your publication.
Our API is designed following the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org).

We implement the [OAuth 2.0 authorization framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) so that you can implement authentication and
authorization for users in your application.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and see example response data for each request.

Our API is only accessible via HTTPS. Enjoy coding!
